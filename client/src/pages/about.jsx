      <p>Going into college, I wanted to challenge myself. Many people told me I would excel at STEM. At the time, I thought it was too easy. 
        So I decided to do something that challenged myself and I was passionate about. I did my degree in Music Education.</p>
      <p>To my surprise, the career I chose to be challenging was challenging. By the end of my first year teaching I realized I didnâ€™t enjoy 
        the constant stress and went back to the drawing table. This time looking for something that is equally interesting, but in an area 
        where I excel.</p>
      <p>As a stop-gap I decided to take up tutoring. I am currently tutoring STEM subjects: chemistry, math, and SATs. While I love my current 
        job, I want to find something full time. Something I could see myself doing long term.</p>
      <p>Enter programming. I had spent my whole life learning the logic behind programming, but I had never taken that next step and learned 
        a real language. I spent this past year learning every language I could get my hands on. Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more. It 
        all came so easy to me. Sure, I had moments where I would pace in a circle and had to explain my problem to a rubber duck. But each 
        problem I ran into I quickly found a solution.</p>
      <p>So why choose me?</p>
      <p>I am a quick learner. A blind person once approached me to help her with orientation and mobility training. I had never even heard of 
        that before. So I spent a week learning about it and three months teaching it to her. In the end, she was able to pass her orientation 
        and mobility test and qualify for a service dog.</p>
      <p>Teamwork is important to me. Everyone has flaws. A good team is one where I am able to help others when they struggle and others are 
        able to help me when I struggle. Asking for help is an underrated skill. Being able to give help is the best feeling in the world.</p>
