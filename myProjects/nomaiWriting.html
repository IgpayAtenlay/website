            <p>This is a word processor that works with a 2D language. The script is based off a videogame called Outer Wilds. In Outer Wilds, there is a species of aliens called Nomai. While we see and can translate their writing, it is actually gibberish. I took the visuals from the game and turned it into a script that you can write English in. Then I took that script and made a program that can generate the script.</p>
